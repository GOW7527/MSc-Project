	abstract = {What Is a First-Passage Process?This book is concerned with the first-passage properties of random walks and diffusion, and the basic consequences of first-passage phenomena. Our starting point is the first-passage probability; this is the probability that a diffusing particle or a random-walk first reaches a specified site (or set of sites) at a specified time. The importance of first-passage phenomena stems from its fundamental role in stochastic processes that are triggered by a first passage event. Typical examples include fluorescence quenching, in which light emission by a fluorescent molecule stops when it reacts with a quencher; integrate-and-fire neurons, in which a neuron fires only when a fluctuating voltage level first reaches a specified level; and the execution of buy/sell orders when a stock price first reaches a threshold. Further illustrations are provided throughout this book.A Simple {IllustrationTo} appreciate the essential features of first-passage phenomena, we begin with a simple example. Suppose that you are a nervous investor who buys stock in a company at a price of \$100. Suppose also that this price fluctuates daily in a random multiplicative fashion. That is, at the end of each day the stock price changes by a multiplicative factor f \&lt; 1 or by f−1 compared with the previous day's price, with each possibility occurring with probability 1/2 (Fig. 1.1). The multiplicative change ensures that the price remains positive. To be concrete, let's take f = 90\% and suppose that there is a loss on the first day so that the stock price drops to \$90.},

    abstract = "{We seek a quantum‐theoretic expression for the probability that an unstable particle prepared initially in a well defined state ρ will be found to decay sometime during a given interval. It is argued that probabilities like this which pertain to continuous monitoring possess operational meaning. A simple natural approach to this problem leads to the conclusion that an unstable particle which is continuously observed to see whether it decays will never be found to decay!. Since recording the track of an unstable particle (which can be distinguished from its decay products) approximately realizes such continuous observations, the above conclusion seems to pose a paradox which we call Zeno’s paradox in quantum theory. The relation of this result to that of some previous works and its implications and possible resolutions are briefly discussed. The mathematical transcription of the above‐mentioned conclusion is a structure theorem concerning semigroups. Although special cases of this theorem are known, the general formulation and the proof given here are believed to be new. We also note that the known ’’no‐go’’ theorem concerning the semigroup law for the reduced evolution of any physical system (including decaying systems) is subsumed under our theorem as a direct corollary.}",

abstract = {It is first shown that the time at which a moving classical particle reaches a fixed space point can be measured with arbitrarily high precision by the use of a suitably conceived apparatus. The same apparatus is then imagined to be exposed to a moving nonrelativistic quantum particle. Von Neumann's theory of quantum measurements is adapted to cover cases like this, in which pieces of information from the measurement process accumulate in the registration stages of the apparatus over an extended period of time. The relevant Schrödinger equation is solved. It is found that the apparatus fails to fulfill its designed purpose if its resolution time is too small. This implies an extension of the uncertainty principle and of the principle of complementarity—there are dynamical variables in classical particle mechanics which even singly admit no perfectly defined quantal counterparts. The status of the particle concept in the interpretation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is discussed in the light of these findings.}

In each step the unitary is followed by a projective measurement checking whether the system has returned to the initial state. We call the system recurrent if this eventually happens with probability one. We show that recurrence is equivalent to the absence of an absolutely continuous part from the spectral measure of U with respect to \$\$\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$\$. We also show that in the recurrent case the expected first return time is an integer or infinite, for which we give a topological interpretation. A key role in our theory is played by the first arrival amplitudes, which turn out to be the (complex conjugated) Taylor coefficients of the Schur function of the spectral measure. On the one hand, this provides a direct dynamical interpretation of these coefficients; on the other hand it links our definition of first return times to a large body of mathematical literature.},

	abstract = {Can Grover's algorithm speed up search of a physical region - for example a 2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to be needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show that this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by Benioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time O(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n){\textasciicircum}(3/2)) for d=2. More generally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs, motivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly the holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this model include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a generalized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties, not just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for unitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an O(sqrt(n))-qubit communication protocol for the disjointness problem, which improves an upper bound of Hoyer and de Wolf and matches a lower bound of Razborov.},

A detector is placed at a fixed location inside the box and its clicking signifies arrival of the particle at the detector. What is the time of arrival ({TOA}) of the particle at the detector ? Within the paradigm of the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics, one can use the idea of projective measurements to define the {TOA}. We consider a setup where a detector keeps making instantaneous measurements at regular finite time intervals until it detects the particle at time t, which is defined as the {TOA}. This is a stochastic variable and, for a simple lattice model of a free particle in a one-dimensional box, we find interesting features such as power-law tails in its distribution and in the probability of survival (non-detection). We propose a perturbative calculational approach which yields results that compare very well with exact numerics.},

	abstract = {Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before the walk reaches an ending condition. To be analogous to the hitting time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogs of hitting time suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of unitary “coin” is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems to play an important role in both dramatic speed-ups and slow-downs of quantum walks.},

One has to sum the amplitudes of all possible paths and square the complex-valued end result to obtain the total probability that the electron arrives at B. That probability consists of a sum of squares—the classical, incoherent contribution—plus many cross-product, interference terms.
